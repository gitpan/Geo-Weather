0.01 Inital version

0.02  Changes to new weather.com site

0.03 Added support for HTTP/1.1 because Weather.com requires HTTP/1.1 only

0.04 Changed how the current condition was located before of more weather.com changes

0.05 Complete rewrite of parsing code because of more weather.com changes. By the looks of their
     new tags, one would hope they will not be making more changes in the near future. Timeout
     code has also been added.
