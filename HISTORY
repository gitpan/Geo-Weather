0.01 Inital version

0.02  Changes to new weather.com site

0.03 Added support for HTTP/1.1 because Weather.com requires HTTP/1.1 only

0.04 Changed how the current condition was located before of more weather.com changes

0.05 Complete rewrite of parsing code because of more weather.com changes. By the looks of their
     new tags, one would hope they will not be making more changes in the near future. Timeout
     code has also been added.

0.06 Added make test and more debugging capabilities.

0.07 Converted to LWP::UserAgent to fix socket problems. Be sure to use a recent libwww-perl so timeout
     code works correctly.

0.08 Added proxy authentication support.

0.09 Changed end of report marker because of more weather.com changes

1.0  Fixed agent string to contain latest version number. Added heat index to report(). Cleaned up documentation.

1.1  More weather.com changes. Added dependancy on LWP::UserAgent. Added new error code when weather.com is too busy to handle requests.
